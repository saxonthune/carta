# Primary Sources

This section contains the author's original writings that inspired and shaped Carta's design direction. These are philosophical and strategic texts — they describe the problems Carta is trying to solve and the intuitions behind its approach.

## How to use these documents

- **Treat as directional intent, not specification.** These writings express goals, hypotheses, and framings. They are not requirements to implement literally.
- **Use for design arbitration.** When a design decision could go multiple ways, these sources reveal the author's mental model and priorities.
- **Do not extract tasks.** A primary source saying "we need X" is the author thinking out loud, not a feature request. Feature requests come through `03-product/` and `todo-tasks/`.

## Relationship to other 01-context docs

Primary sources are the raw thinking that produced `01-mission.md` and `02-principles.md`. Mission and principles are distilled and canonical; primary sources are the unfiltered reasoning behind them.
