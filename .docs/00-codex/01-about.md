# About This Codex

This is the canonical documentation for Carta. It uses a numbered title system where each title covers one category of knowledge, organized by reader intent.

## How to Read

**New to the project?** Start with `01-context/` — mission, principles, and glossary.

**Need to understand internals?** Read `02-system/` — architecture, state management, interfaces, and design decisions.

**Want to know what Carta does?** Browse `03-product/` — feature catalog, use cases, and step-by-step workflows.

**Need to build, test, or deploy?** See `04-operations/`.

## Cross-References

Documents reference each other using `doc` syntax: `docXX.YY.ZZ` where each segment is a two-digit number mapping to the directory/file numbering. For example, `doc03.01.02.01` refers to title 03 (product), subdir 01 (features), subdir 02 (output), item 01 (compilation).

See doc00.03 for full conventions.

## One Canonical Location

Every concept has exactly one canonical document. Other documents reference it rather than re-explaining. If you're tempted to describe something that already has a doc, link to it instead.
