# Compile a Project

## Steps

1. Create constructs and connections on the canvas (doc03.03.01, doc03.03.02)
2. Optionally organize constructs into deployables
3. Click "Compile" in the header
4. The Compile Modal opens with structured JSON output
5. Review the output — constructs are grouped by deployable, then by type
6. Copy to clipboard or download as .txt file
7. Paste into an AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) as architecture context

## Output Contents

- Deployable definitions
- Schema definitions with field specs and port configurations
- Construct instances with field values and relationship metadata
- Bidirectional references (references/referencedBy) using semantic IDs

## Features

- doc03.01.02.01 (Compilation)
