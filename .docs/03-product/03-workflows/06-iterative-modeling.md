# Iterative Modeling on the Map

Higher-level modeling activities that compose atomic workflows (doc03.03.01–05) into creative, iterative work on the canvas.

## Fiddle with Pieces

Rearrange, reconnect, and reshape existing constructs until the picture looks right. Move nodes around, try different groupings, swap connections. The goal is spatial reasoning — seeing whether the arrangement "feels" correct before committing to it.

- **Features**: doc03.01.01 (Canvas), doc03.01.03 (Ports and Connections)
- **Atomic workflows**: doc03.03.01, doc03.03.02

## Add to an Incomplete Picture

Drop new constructs into an area that's partially modeled. Fill gaps, add missing relationships, flesh out a subsystem that was only sketched. The user knows roughly what's needed and is completing the picture.

- **Features**: doc03.01.01 (Canvas), doc03.01.02 (Constructs)
- **Atomic workflows**: doc03.03.01, doc03.03.02

## Start a New Area

Begin modeling a new subsystem or concern on a blank region of the canvas (or a new level). The user shifts attention from a completed area to an unexplored one.

- **Features**: doc03.01.01 (Canvas), doc03.01.04 (Levels)

## Start Over, Salvage the Good Parts

The current model isn't working. Delete most of it but keep the pieces that are solid. Copy good constructs to a new level or region, then rebuild around them.

- **Features**: doc03.01.01 (Canvas), doc03.01.04 (Levels), doc03.01.11 (Keyboard and Clipboard)

## Copy from a Picture or Notebook

Bring constructs from another level, another document, or a previous version. Paste them into the current context and adapt them to fit.

- **Features**: doc03.01.04 (Levels), doc03.01.11 (Keyboard and Clipboard), doc03.01.08 (Import/Export)

## Jump to Solve a Prerequisite Problem

While modeling, realize a dependency needs to be designed first. Switch to a different level or area, solve that problem, then return to the original work.

- **Features**: doc03.01.04 (Levels), doc03.01.01 (Canvas)

## Move Between Levels of Abstraction

Zoom out to see the big picture, zoom in to detail a specific component. Switch between levels to work at different granularities. The model exists at multiple scales simultaneously.

- **Features**: doc03.01.04 (Levels), doc03.01.01 (Canvas)
