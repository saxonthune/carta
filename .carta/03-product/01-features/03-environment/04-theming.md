# Theming

Carta supports three visual themes, selectable from the theme picker icon in the header toolbar (left of Settings gear):

- **Light**: Default light theme
- **Dark**: Dark background with adjusted contrast
- **Warm**: Warm-toned variant

Theme selection persists to localStorage and applies immediately. The theme affects application chrome, canvas background, node colors, and all UI elements.
